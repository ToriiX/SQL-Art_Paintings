## Famous Paintings Data Tables, Project in MySQL

In this project, I used the data "Famous Paintings" downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings) to practise my SQL skills in MySQL. 

Python was utilized to upload the data to the database in MySQL efficiently. See own deposit for code. 

I looked at the artists and works represented in the data, as well as styles, subjects, specific sizes and prices. In the end, I took a better look at the American artists represented, and what work can be viewed in the US.

Some of the takeaways:

- The overall most popular subject in the data was Portraits, while "Landscape art" was the most represented subject by American artists
- The overall most widely represented painting style was Baroque, while it in the US museums was Impressionism
- The very famous "The Last Supper" by Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the largest represented paintings
- The most expensive picture at regular price was "The Luncheon" by Claude Monet
- "Landscape art" was the most expensive subject on average followed by "Maritime art/Maritime"
- "American Landscape" was the most expensive painting style on average, followed by Classicism
